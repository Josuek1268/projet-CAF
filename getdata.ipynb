Cybercrime cost the continent $4 billion in 2022, with attacks targeting critical sectors like infrastructure.Here are some key insights from our discussion:Awareness Gaps: Cybersecurity has historically been under-prioritised in Africa. Many organisations lack the training, skills, and budgets to effectively combat cyber threats.  My Take: Leaders must implement cybersecurity frameworks and invest in regular training to build a security-conscious culture across their teams.AI as a Double-Edged Sword: AI has the potential to enhance defences, but it also introduces new risks if exploited by cybercriminals.  My Take: Combining AI tools with human expertise and setting up AI governance structures are critical steps to ensure AI is an asset, not a liability.Government Support & Regulation: Governments play a vital role in providing budgetary support and ensuring cybersecurity legislation is understood and enforced.  My Take: Public-private partnerships are essential. Governments need to create incentives for cybersecurity investments and facilitate information sharing to build a more robust ecosystem.Education & Infrastructure Investment: By investing in education and digital infrastructure, Africa can protect itself from future cyber threats while capitalising on AI’s potential.  My Take: Prioritising cybersecurity education from schools to professional certifications will build a more robust workforce, and digital infrastructure investment will be crucial to keeping pace with technological advances.Looking ahead, AI could add $1.2 billion to Africa’s GDP by 2030—but we must act now to secure our digital future.

Emmanuel IntroductionArtificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize economies and societies. For African governments, attracting AI investments can drive innovation, create jobs, and enhance productivity across various sectors. This research paper explores strategies that African governments can employ to attract AI investments, supported by real-world examples.1. Developing a Robust Regulatory Framework.A clear and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for attracting AI investments. Governments should establish policies that promote ethical AI use, protect data privacy, and ensure fair competition.Example:Kenya: Kenya has been proactive in developing AI regulations. The government has implemented policies to protect data privacy and promote ethical AI use, which has attracted companies like OpenAI and WorldCoin.2. Investing in Digital Infrastructure.Investments in digital infrastructure, such as high-speed internet, data centers, and cybersecurity, are essential to support AI development and deployment.Example:Rwanda: Rwanda has invested heavily in its digital infrastructure, including the rollout of 4G networks nationwide and the establishment of innovation hubs. This has made Rwanda an attractive destination for tech companies and AI startups.3. Promoting Education and Skills Development.Building a skilled workforce is vital for AI innovation. Governments should invest in education and training programs to develop AI expertise.Example:Nigeria: Nigeria has launched several initiatives to promote AI education, including partnerships with tech companies to provide AI training and certification programs. This has helped create a pool of skilled professionals ready to work in the AI sector.4. Creating Innovation Hubs and IncubatorsInnovation hubs and incubators provide startups with the resources and support they need to develop and scale AI solutions. These hubs can attract both local and international investments.Example:South Africa: The Tshimologong Digital Innovation Precinct in Johannesburg is a prime example of an innovation hub that supports tech startups, including those focused on AI. It offers resources such as funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities.5. Fostering Public-Private Partnerships.Collaborations between the government and private sector can drive AI innovation and investment. Public-private partnerships can provide funding, expertise, and infrastructure needed for AI projects.Example:Egypt: Egypt has fostered public-private partnerships to advance its AI agenda. The government collaborates with tech giants like IBM and Microsoft to develop AI solutions for various sectors, including healthcare and agriculture.https://lnkd.in/drrymXbf - 2024-09-30 \n",

The registrar responsible for administering the mail servers has said he's received over 100,000 emails since January alone.https://lnkd.in/ejDjE8ZCHow is this even possible? Through a basic typo of \"ml\" instead of \"mil\" - for example:An email intended for <firstname.lastname>@army.mil (a domain owned by the US Army) is accidentally entered into the email client as <firstname.lastname>@army.ml (a domain owned/operated in Mali). That's it - no crazy hack, no zero day, a simple typo - and a typo that anyone could make.Technology should absolutely be used as a fall back for human error - not the other way round.Which is why this is exactly the sort of case study that was thought of when we developed our new \"Misdirected Email\" plug-in for Microsoft Outlook. By leveraging the power of our Machine Learning to understand what external recipients you normally interact with, users will get a notification whenever they attempt to send an email to an address that is unusual and resembles one that is a lot more common for them to communicate with. The use of Machine Learning in this case, allows the deployment to \"learn on the job\", without having to pre-configure or supply it with a list of known good (or known bad) domains that could easily change from one day to the next.A small addition to our Darktrace for Email capability, but clearly a much needed one.hashtag#ai hashtag#machinelearning hashtag#cybersecurity - 2024-10-14 \n",

AI developers need to implement security practices that have become standard in other areas of software development, including supply chain transparency (through what is known as a “software bill of materials”) and the establishment of rigorous, objective testing and validation procedures.2. The industry needs to develop a transparent way to measure reliability and security. The threshold of acceptable risk will vary from context to context, but until some objective metric can be placed on the riskiness of AI, everything will be in the unenforceable realm of “appropriate” and “reasonable.” We have objective standards in other fields, from building codes to airplane autopilots. 3. Developers need to stop releasing to the public AI models that pose serious, unmitigated risks. In this regard, the rapid roll-out of insecure AI is no different from the software industry’s long habit of shipping insecure product, only to have to patch it later. The Biden administration’s cybersecurity strategy calls out this ship-and-patch mentality as a major reason why our computer systems are so insecure, and the same holds for AI.

But it is quite obvious that we need to live in a society with rules and regulations. John Barlow's Declaration of Cyberspace Independence doesn't work. The question we should be asking ourselves is WHEN TO REGULATE? When should least developed countries start regulating AI? How do we get to the point of AI Regulation from a point where countries are still battling with internet access, data protection and basic cybersecurity? Should countries start with AI regulatory sandboxing to get a better contextual understanding of AI and their unique needs? Should they conduct AI risk assessments and feasibility studies first? Should they start with policies and AI strategies? Any of these options require a lot of money, money that may not be available for most developing countries.Fortunately, UNESCO and the European Commission have committed to provide €4 million towards the establishment of national AI legislation in developing countries. This financial commitment will make a huge difference for these countries. But this brings me back to my earlier question - when should we regulate AI? Is this the right time for developing countries like African countries to start regulating AI? Is it more strategic if this money goes towards helping African governments understand AI, identify their needs, risks and opportunities in AI and develop fit for purpose AI Regulation? Since most of these governments lack the financial muscle to do these AI studies, getting funding from the EC and developing an AI law may be the easy way out. The danger with this is they are likely to copy and paste regulation from their funders, which may not always be applicable in their country context. We have seen this with data protection regulation. (After moving to Europe, I now understand why they had to have the GDPR in place. There is too much personal data collected. You can't even get a trash bin without getting your personal data processed. This is very different from most African countries). Public consultation and participation is part of the democratic machinery when passing new laws. The problem is most people in Africa don't understand or know anything about AI. So they may not be able to contribute towards the shaping of AI Laws. How will I be able to explain the risks of AI to my rural community in Zimbabwe where internet signal is very bad and people occasionally use internet for WhatsApp? I think at times we are caught up in this hype of regulatory frenzy and forget about realities in certain areas.https://lnkd.in/eXhA8pME - 2024-10-10 \n",

The report touched on 3 main technologies applicable in the FinTech industry. These are AI, Blockchain, and Cloud Services. Below are my key takeaways from the report with a few additions. Artificial Intelligence (AI)1. Largest AI developers in Africa are South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, and Morocco.2. Ghana is at 6th position with 115 companies specializing in AI.3. The downside of AI in Africa are that it is more likely to further the pre-existing biases and oppression of women, ethnic minorities, and marginalized groups. 4. There also exists a gender diversity issue in the AI industry, with 71% of employees being male and 29% being female. Similarly, AI development students are 77% male and 23% female.AI Regulation & Strategy1. The first national AI strategy frameworks in Africa were developed by Egypt, Mauritania, and Rwanda. 2. The current situation is that governments are struggling to keep pace with the development of AI technology. 3. AI companies in the private sector now practice self-regulation as a result.4. The persistent public sentiment is that regulating AI policy does not match the needs of the citizens presently.5. In June of 2023, Ghana’s Minister of Communications assured parliament that measures were being put in place to regulate AI.AI & E-commerce1. The current relationship between AI and e-commerce is a positive one.2. The mass adoption and vast data as a result of digital-only interactions allow for the creation of individualized financial products. 3. It also allows for faster creation and training of algorithms in Africa as compared to developed nations.4. Some of the uses to which AI is being put to are;a. customer behavior analysis b. demographics c. personalized customer experiences d. cybersecurity and fraud prevention (likely by holders of PFTSP license in Ghana).The Problems Identified with African E-commerce1. Unavailability of data as a result of less digitized locations.2. Limited data collection methods.3. Shortage of talent in the data science field in Africa.BLOCKCHAIN1. Ownership of digital currency has been expanding in Africa, with Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa having the highest number of users of crypto assets. 2. African FinTechs and financial services industries are embracing blockchain due to its peculiar nature (of being immutable, decentralized, and transparent) for;a. remittancesb. supply chain financingc. digital identity verificationd. peer-to-peer lending etc.hashtag#fintech hashtag#finextra hashtag#AIhashtag#future - 2024-09-23 \n",

It is naive to think there are incalculable, infallible, and 24/7 digital walls, barriers, complex security and 'protection' between you, harm, loss, disruption, destruction or exploitation. But it's not you; specifically, they may be hunting or seeking to leverage, but that of your community, locale, country or demographic(s). Moreover, a single adversary prefers to hunt the pack, like a predatory African mammal, like a lion. But instead of hunting a pack for a single meal (usually the slowest, weakest or least attentive), contemporary, syndicated, capable and persistent digital threats want to consume the entire herd... or multiple herds at once. Forget physical apex predators; the modern digital adversary, both human-centric (corporeal) and automated (AI, ML, Bots, etc.), continues to be an adaptive, agile and intelligent danger the world and human history have never experienced. Unlike traditional or conventional criminals, bad actors and terrorists are limited in time, space and effort to harm and attack victims. Even wars are constrained to specific territories, adversaries and munitions. Digital actors can achieve mass casualties with the click of a mouse or by hitting enter on their devices. You, your business, your community, your data, your life, your information, your money, your health and your future are all worthy rewards in one form or another to one or more digital predators. Remembering, of course, the digital predator may be a child, elderly, person with a disability, infirm or gravely ill (and invisible to you or the other side of the world), but they remain a deadly and effective predator nonetheless.

      "Post ajouté: Ibrahim SalifouIbrahim Salifou - Nabhane Mohamed NOUHOUMShamim nabuuma KaliisaDjamiou Ohounko (Baba)When we dive into the world of fintech, it becomes crystal clear that intellectual property (IP) is absolutely central. I mean, it's the beating heart of modern legal systems, especially in the fintech arena. We're talking about this dynamic field that brings together creativity, innovation, and the financial sector. Now, IP covers a whole bunch of intangible stuff like patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. And here's the kicker – these give creators and innovators these special rights that are all about exclusivity.Now, in the ever-moving fintech landscape, where tech and finance get all tangled up, IP law plays a starring role in pushing growth and making sure competition is on the level. This is where the legal framework rolls out the red carpet for developers, entrepreneurs, and financial institutions to put their time, money, and effort into their ideas. They know that their IP is going to be shielded and respected.What's really cool about IP law in fintech is how it strikes this delicate balance between giving creators their special rights and making sure knowledge spreads. Sure, IP rights give creators the power to call the shots on how their stuff is used. But hold on – there are limits too. The law takes a step back and tries to find that sweet spot between what creators want and what's good for the fintech community as a whole. That's why you've got these exceptions and rules that let you do things like research, fair use, and critical analysis.With fintech going global, the harmony of IP laws across different places takes the spotlight. International agreements, like the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), have kind of paved the way for a unified approach to IP protection.But wait, the fintech world isn't all smooth sailing. There are challenges too, like digital piracy, the need to shield algorithms and secret sauce software, and ensuring that our cybersecurity game is on point. And let's not forget about the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning – they're throwing a spanner in the works. We're having these deep conversations about who really owns the AI-generated financial stuff and algorithms.So, summing it up, the whole world of intellectual property law in fintech is this big, swirling ecosystem that has a massive impact on how we build, share, and protect financial technology innovations. In the face of new tech and fresh financial solutions, IP laws are changing up their game to make sure creators are looked after, all while giving fintech innovation a safe space to keep growing. - 2023-11-14 \n",

In the right hands and used responsibly, this data represents limitless opportunities for growth and digital advancement. In the wrong hands, it exposes individuals and organisations to levels of cybercrime that have the potential to cause untold financial and data losses, even crippling businesses.Recent market research reports that the global big data market is set to grow from USD 138.9 billion in 2020 to USD 229.4 billion by 2025, due in part to the escalating demand for data-driven decision-making by organisations looking to gain a competitive advantage.With big data comes the need for equally substantial cyber security solutions. 𝗔𝗳𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗮’𝘀 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗰𝘆𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲With African countries at various stages of implementing digital transformation initiatives, the continent has become a fertile hunting ground for increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals. With the number of internet users in Africa expected to reach 1.1 billion by 2029, cyber security has never been more important. In South Africa for instance, the Allianz Risk Barometer ranks cyber incidents as the second most dangerous risk (after critical infrastructure blackouts).From ransomware to phishing, malware and data breaches, the methods are varied, and the results are often catastrophic. Compounding this are outdated, inflexible (and often manual) legacy security controls that can’t keep pace with the enormous scale of data being produced. The result: many African organisations find themselves on the receiving end of threats that simply couldn’t be detected or responded to quickly enough. 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀To mitigate these threats, businesses are increasingly working with technology companies like Liquid Intelligent Technologies (Liquid) to automate cyber security-related tasks traditionally performed by human analysts, such as monitoring networks, identifying vulnerabilities, and responding to incidents. Using advanced software and technologies to take care of these tasks results in increased efficiencies, reduced instances of human error, and faster response times. Employees are freed up to concentrate on other aspects of the business.In an even more advanced step, predictive analytics analyse the large sets of data generated by organisations to identify patterns and predict and mitigate potential threats before they even occur.

According to a report by Performanta, the continent is being used as a testing ground for ransomware operations. Despite progress in cybersecurity, many nations still lack strong national defenses, making them vulnerable targets. ️Why Africa?  Weaker systems in certain regions provide cyber gangs the opportunity to refine their methods before moving on to attack more secure countries. A recent ransomware incident involving South Africa’s National Health Laboratory Service highlights the urgency for enhanced cybersecurity measures across the continent. Signs to Watch:Cybercriminals are no longer limiting their attacks to high-value sectors like finance or energy. We're seeing an uptick in ransomware campaigns across a variety of industries, particularly in Kenya and Nigeria. Many businesses remain underprotected, with only 17 African nations having a national cybersecurity strategy in place. The Solution? Stronger regional collaboration and updated cybersecurity strategies are crucial to staying ahead of these evolving threats. African businesses must be proactive and fortify their defenses to prevent being used as testing grounds for global cybercriminals.hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Africa hashtag#Ransomware hashtag#CyberDefense hashtag#DigitalSecurity hashtag#AfricaTech hashtag#ThreatIntelligence - 2024-09-30 \n",

      "Post ajouté: Bunmi Bajomo (PhD)Bunmi Bajomo (PhD) - The Rise of Cybercrime in Africa: A growing threatIn recent years, cybercrime has skyrocketed globally, with the number of successful cyberattacks more than doubling in the past five years. This alarming trend is also evident in Africa. In 2023, the continent recorded the highest number of weekly cyberattacks per organizationThe Internet, a cornerstone of this technological era, is vital for managing critical infrastructures, executing secure financial transactions, maintaining connections with loved ones, indulging in online shopping, and accessing a wealth of information and entertainment.However, the digital age comes with its own set of challenges, mainly, the escalating threat of cybercrime. As technology advances, so do the tactics used by cybercriminals, who employ increasingly sophisticated methods to exploit vulnerabilities, posing a significant risk to individuals and organizations alike. Victims are often left financially, psychologically and emotionally destitute.The Economic Impact of CybercrimeThe economic toll of cybercrime in Africa is substantial. According to a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), cybercrime costs African countries an estimated 1.5% of their GDP annually. This figure is likely to increase as the continent's digital economy grows.Social engineering(a type of attack that exploits human psychology to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information) plays a role in 52% of successful attacks on organizations and 91% on individuals in Africa. Several factors contribute to the rise of cybercrime in Africa;- Rapid Digitalization - Lack of Cybersecurity Awareness ️- Weak Cybersecurity Infrastructure ️- Organized Crime ‍️The volume and impact of cybercrimes continue to surge across Africa. Ransomware, business email compromise, and other online scams were the fastest growing cyber threats in 2023. Based on INTERPOL data, in recent years, Ghana’s government institutions, the national banks of Zambia and South Sudan, government institutions in Ethiopia, Senegal and Zimbabwe, and a popular South African Internet service provider have all been subjected to ransomware attacks.To combat cybercrime effectively, a multi-faceted approach is required. This includes;- Investing in robust cybersecurity infrastructure.- Raising awareness about cybersecurity threats and best practices.- Developing and implementing laws/regulations to address cybercrime and strengthening law enforcement capabilities to investigate and prosecute cybercriminals.- Fostering international cooperation among governments, law enforcement agencies, and private sector organizations to combat cybercrime on a global scale.As Africa continues to embrace digital technologies, it is imperative to prioritize cybersecurity to protect its economic growth and development. By addressing the challenges posed by cybercrime, the continent can harness the full potential of the digital age while minimizing the risks. - 2024-10-09 \n",

Cybercrime cost the continent $4 billion in 2022, with attacks targeting critical sectors like infrastructure.Here are some key insights from our discussion:Awareness Gaps: Cybersecurity has historically been under-prioritised in Africa. Many organisations lack the training, skills, and budgets to effectively combat cyber threats.  My Take: Leaders must implement cybersecurity frameworks and invest in regular training to build a security-conscious culture across their teams.AI as a Double-Edged Sword: AI has the potential to enhance defences, but it also introduces new risks if exploited by cybercriminals.  My Take: Combining AI tools with human expertise and setting up AI governance structures are critical steps to ensure AI is an asset, not a liability.Government Support & Regulation: Governments play a vital role in providing budgetary support and ensuring cybersecurity legislation is understood and enforced.  My Take: Public-private partnerships are essential. Governments need to create incentives for cybersecurity investments and facilitate information sharing to build a more robust ecosystem.Education & Infrastructure Investment: By investing in education and digital infrastructure, Africa can protect itself from future cyber threats while capitalising on AI’s potential.  My Take: Prioritising cybersecurity education from schools to professional certifications will build a more robust workforce, and digital infrastructure investment will be crucial to keeping pace with technological advances.Looking ahead, AI could add $1.2 billion to Africa’s GDP by 2030—but we must act now to secure our digital future.

      "Post ajouté: Toluwalase Akorede KadiriToluwalase Akorede Kadiri - My journey in cybersecurity took me to CyBlack last month. The first project focused on cyber threat intelligence (CTI), which focuses on gathering information to identify vulnerabilities and threats. A few days ago, I used open-source tools (e.g., Whois, Domain Dossier, VirusTotal, etc.) to conduct CTI about SecureX, a hypothetical fintech company based in Nigeria.After gathering relevant information, my team and I conducted a risk assessment to discuss the vulnerabilities and threats every asset identified is susceptible to. We also discussed the controls to stem the tide of the weaknesses. The fun (and not-so-fun-bit ) was the research on threat actors/ransomware groups likely to attack SecureX. I focused on Phobos, LockBit, Scattered Spider, & FIN7. Like clockwork, the bulk of the attacks from the aforementioned ransomware groups focused on the banking industry, the same sector SecureX operates (see image 2).The most intriguing part was using the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand the threat, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) of malicious actors, especially Phobos, which I examined in great detail. Some facts about the Phobos group: 1. They attacked 600+ companies in the first half of 2024 alone, which is the second highest behind LockBit with 1,360 attacks (see image 1 for the full scoop). They are active in Africa and (specifically) Nigeria. In July 2024, the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT) released mitigation steps against the malicious group. Read it here: https://lnkd.in/dMQZWJDb 2. They have multiple variants (Faust, 8Base, Elking) using their malware strain. Each variant uses unique invasion tactics and tools, making it hard to defend against the group. 3. They’re master phishers, but that's not all: they know how to exploit remote desktop protocols.

      "Post ajouté: Frank Iseh CISSP.Frank Iseh CISSP. - The Growing Threat of Targeted Spear Phishing Against Senior Executives in AfricaAs Africa's business landscape rapidly evolves, so does the sophistication of cyber threats, particularly targeted spear phishing aimed at senior executives. This alarming trend underscores the urgent need for heightened awareness and protective measures among Africa's leadership.Understanding Spear Phishing in the African ContextSpear phishing campaigns are no longer just a Western concern; they are increasingly tailored to exploit the unique dynamics of African organizations. Cybercriminals often conduct thorough research, gathering personal and professional information from social media, corporate websites, and public records. This allows them to craft convincing messages that resonate with their targets, often making use of local languages and cultural references.Why Executives Are TargetedSenior executives in Africa are prime targets for several reasons:1. Access to Sensitive Information: Executives have the keys to a wealth of confidential data, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals seeking to exploit financial or intellectual property.2. Increased Digitalization: As companies across Africa embrace digital transformation, the attack surface grows. Many organizations lack robust cybersecurity frameworks, making them more vulnerable.3. Busy Schedules: Executives often juggle numerous responsibilities, which can lead to a lapse in vigilance. A well-crafted email can easily slip through the cracks, especially when it appears to come from a trusted source.Consequences of Successful AttacksThe repercussions of spear phishing can be particularly severe in Africa. Beyond immediate financial losses, organizations may face regulatory penalties, loss of customer trust, and even reputational damage on a continental scale. Given the rapid growth of the African market, the stakes have never been higher. A successful attack not only impacts the targeted company but can also ripple through entire industries.Prevention Strategies1. Education and Training: Continuous training is essential. Executives should be educated about the latest phishing techniques and how to recognize suspicious communications.2. Verification Protocols: Encourage a culture of verification. Simple practices, such as confirming requests via a phone call, can thwart potential attacks.3. Robust Cybersecurity Frameworks: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and advanced threat detection systems tailored to the specific challenges faced by African businesses.ConclusionAs spear phishing becomes more prevalent in Africa, protecting senior executives must be a top priority. By fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness and implementing effective measures. Together, we can build a safer business environment for Africa's executives and the organizations they lead.hashtag#cloudsecurity hashtag#phishing hashtag#digitalwitch hashtag#azure hashtag#gcp hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#staysafe hashtag#securityawareness - 2024-10-09 \n",

In the right hands and used responsibly, this data represents limitless opportunities for growth and digital advancement. In the wrong hands, it exposes individuals and organisations to levels of cybercrime that have the potential to cause untold financial and data losses, even crippling businesses.Recent market research reports that the global big data market is set to grow from USD 138.9 billion in 2020 to USD 229.4 billion by 2025, due in part to the escalating demand for data-driven decision-making by organisations looking to gain a competitive advantage.With big data comes the need for equally substantial cyber security solutions. 𝗔𝗳𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗮’𝘀 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗰𝘆𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲With African countries at various stages of implementing digital transformation initiatives, the continent has become a fertile hunting ground for increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals. With the number of internet users in Africa expected to reach 1.1 billion by 2029, cyber security has never been more important. In South Africa for instance, the Allianz Risk Barometer ranks cyber incidents as the second most dangerous risk (after critical infrastructure blackouts).From ransomware to phishing, malware and data breaches, the methods are varied, and the results are often catastrophic. Compounding this are outdated, inflexible (and often manual) legacy security controls that can’t keep pace with the enormous scale of data being produced. The result: many African organisations find themselves on the receiving end of threats that simply couldn’t be detected or responded to quickly enough.

      "Post ajouté: Jan NelJan Nel - Digital identity and high-value asset identification: Safeguarding your most critical resources Safeguarding a person’s digital identity has become vital in today’s connected environment. Unlike IDs and passports, a digital identity encompasses all the unique identifiers and credentials that individuals use to authenticate themselves online. The scope of this is therefore significant and requires a considered approach to protect as effectively as possible. Usernames, passwords, biometric data, and even digital certificates all form part of a digital identity. However, when it comes to high-value assets, the focus turns to recognising and safeguarding the most critical assets within a company. If any of these are compromised, the business will likely suffer significant financial and reputational damage. There is also the potential of disrupting daily operations thereby exacerbating the cost aspects. High-value assets can include data, intellectual property, proprietary information, and critical infrastructure. The consequences of cyberattacks on South African organisations have been significant, with a 10% reduction in GDP attributed to cybercrime. While many companies believe that as long as they have firewalls and encryption in place, their most critical resources are safe, the reality is quite different. These traditional cybersecurity solutions often overlook the sophisticated tactics that cybercriminals use to breach these defences. Phishing, social engineering, and credential stuffing are just some of the ways malicious users can gain unauthorised access to sensitive systems and data. With South Africa becoming the 5th highest country in the world for cybercrime, securing digital identities on both personal and high-asset levels has become non-negotiable. To mitigate these risks, companies need to employ a comprehensive approach to digital identity management and high-value asset protection. Extensive identity and access management (IAM) solutions that ensure only authorised users can access critical systems are integral in this regard. These solutions include multi-factor authentication (MFA), regular auditing of access rights, and the use of advanced analytics to detect and respond to unusual activity. When it comes to high-value assets, businesses need to extensively audit and identify their most critical resources. The best way to defend these resources is to adopt layered security measures. These could include encryption, real-time monitoring, and segmentation of networks to limit the potential impact of a breach. C-suite executives must understand that digital identity and high-value asset protection have evolved beyond ‘IT’s problem’. Instead, they are business priorities. By focusing on these areas, organisations can take the required steps to defend against cyber threats while also building a resilient environment that can help safeguard their most valuable resources. - 2024-07-14 \n",

      "Post ajouté: David OdesDavid Odes -  How often do you hear about a foreign government hijacking another nation’s surveillance tools?Well, it just happened. Chinese hackers reportedly infiltrated U.S. telecom networks, accessing the same tools used by the U.S. authorities to monitor Americans. For months, they stayed undetected, silently collecting sensitive data.Here’s the problem: Governments worldwide require telecom providers to install backdoors for national security purposes. But these access points can easily be exploited by foreign actors, putting citizen privacy at risk.The U.S. breach is alarming—but the implications for Africa are even more concerning:• Nigeria has spent over $2.7B on surveillance systems in the last decade.• African governments continue to invest billions into these technologies.• Chinese firms dominate Africa's surveillance tech market.• These systems are already misused to spy on citizens and political opponents—and once compromised, they expose personal data to foreign governments.Bottom line: Governments can’t be trusted to protect your digital privacy.This is why you have to take your privacy into your own hands:1. Secure Your Communications: Use encrypted channels like Signal or WhatsApp. Calls & texts on those platforms are end-to-end encrypted and are much safer for sensitive discussions. Switch to ProtonMail for sensitive emails.2. Strengthen Your Security: Install reputable VPNs like ProtonVPN & or use Cloudflare WARP to protect your browsing history. Keep devices updated and use password managers like Bitwarden.3. Protect Your Identity: Enable two-factor authentication and regularly review privacy settings in your social media apps. Have different emails for various services. 4. Stay Informed: Learn about your country's data protection laws, follow digital rights organisations like Web Security Lab, and audit your digital footprint regularly.Your privacy is your responsibility—don't leave it in the hands of those who might exploit it.Oh, and by the way...

But for these companies to scale, thrive, and lead the Digital Ecosystem, one thing is non-negotiable: Digital Trust. Why Digital Trust MattersIn an era where transactions, data, and integrations are all moving online, trust becomes the currency that fuels growth. Customers, investors, and regulators demand it. It’s no longer enough to offer groundbreaking products or services; you need to ensure Security, Privacy, and Ethical use of technology.But how do African unicorns, companies valued at over $1 billion; build and maintain this Digital Trust? Three Pillars of Digital Trust for Africa’s Unicorns1. Security and Privacy by DesignFrom day one, unicorns need to embed security into every layer of their digital platforms. This means building systems with end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and rigorous data privacy protocols. It’s not just about protecting data; it’s about giving customers the peace of mind that their information is in good hands.2. Transparency and AccountabilityTrust is earned when companies are open about how they collect, use, and protect data. African unicorns must lead by example, adopting transparent practices and being accountable when things go wrong. Whether it’s dealing with breaches or communicating changes in policy, honesty is what will set leaders apart from the rest.3. Compliance with Global StandardsAfrican tech giants can’t afford to think locally when it comes to Digital Trust. To attract international partners and customers, they must comply with global security standards like GDPR, SOC2, and ISO certifications. Being proactive about these regulations is crucial for building credibility on the world stage. Unlocking the Future of African Tech!Digital Trust is the foundation for enabling unicorns to grow beyond borders. The companies that invest in trust today will not only expand their reach but also pave the way for the next generation of African tech innovators. They will unlock new markets, attract global talent, and redefine what’s possible for the continent’s Digital Ecosystem.

The lecture was moderated by Prof Admire Mare with Prof Sarah Chiumbu and Prof Allen Munoriyarwa being discussants.While digital platforms are varied, my interest is more in AI. This is moreso because the increased uptake of AI tools warrants the question of whether African countries should exercise their hashtag#sovereignty and leapfrog to AI regulation, or alternatively take their time to acquire knowledge around AI.I generally agree with perspectives that contend that African nations should not prioritise the enactment of AI-specific hashtag#legislation, but rather concentrate on enhancing the fundamental standards governing data management. The effective implementation and enforcement of data protection legislation constitutes the initial step in the progression towards AI regulation. Data protection legislation offers directives on the handling of personal data, including biometrics, the utilisation of profiling instruments, and automated processing, as well as the scope of these activities and the rights of persons.The Malabo Convention - the African Union (AU) Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, already operational – serves as a crucial instrument for regulating elements of AI, including the automated processing of personal data. For data protection laws to effectively regulate AI in Africa, it is essential for the 18 African countries lacking such legislation to enact pertinent national laws.Africa must prioritise the establishment of robust data regulators with enforcement capabilities, exemplified by Kenya’s Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) and South Africa’s Information Regulator. The legislative hashtag#framework should be structured to ensure that data regulators possess enhanced financial, institutional, and political independence, hence preventing susceptibility to political and commercial sector coercion and intimidation.The implementation of premature regulation may hinder hashtag#innovation. The wait-and-see strategy includes comprehending AI technology into controlled contexts, such as AI regulatory hashtag#sandboxes, where these technologies are evaluated against current regulations.Thoughts?

Upon seeing Tekedia’s report, I couldn’t help but ask myself: Where is cybersecurity? Is no one building a cybersecurity solution or startup worthy of investment in Africa?While well-invested industries are critical to economic growth, it’s worth noting that failing to invest in digital safety will invite severe consequences for governments, businesses and individuals.Africa isn’t immune to threat actors As the world deepens and widens its unbridled romance with the internet and technology, government and corporate agencies are more vulnerable to digital invasions by a teeming population of threat actors. No country is immune, and the potential damage from cyberattacks varies depending on the level of preparedness of the target. Consider the case of the West African country of Liberia. Over a million Lonestar Cell MTN customers were suddenly denied internet access in 2016, thanks to the calculated invasion of the network provider’s server with fake traffic. Although the authorities nabbed the culprit, multiple financial transactions failed and workers in the health and transport sectors bemoaned the loss of connectivity. This affirms the extent of the damage that hackers can deal to prey lacking a reliable firewall and other security mechanisms.Admittedly, the pandemic accelerated digital transformation for many countries and organisations. The work-from-home trend greatly improved employee engagement and productivity. But it came at a significant cost. As more jobs became remote, the risk of cyberattacks grew.

The topics up for deliberation? 1) Protecting The Right of Migrant Workers2) Human Rights in the Digital SphereBy international standards, China isn't doing well in either area; whatever the definition of \"well\" is. I was naturally more interested in the second topic and I had some idea of China's peculiarity in the digital space. Diving into research however, a popular IG reel sound started playing in my head - \"Ah, Dangerous ndege kwaMzilikazi\" (google Dangrous by Jah Prayzah). Nice research soundtrack innit? Because China was really going against the grain here. It was comforting at least that I could be proud of China's laudable actions with regards to the conference's general theme: \"Securing Our Shared Future: Mitigating the Effects of Our Actions and Inactions on Food Security Towards Achieving The Agenda 2030\".Now my job is done, and I'm here to comment as a concerned citizen of the world.

With the rapid rise in digitisation as a result of the pandemic, the broad implementation of such laws across the continent has never been more urgent. Countries including Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Togo, Uganda and Zimbabwe have been implementing new measures to protect and secure the personal information of their citizens. In Ghana, data protection is regulated under the Data Protection Act, 2012 (DPA) together with Article 18(2) of the 1992 Constitution, which provides citizens with a fundamental right to privacy. Enid Baaba Dadzie, Senior Associate at Kimathi & Partners in Ghana, says that because data protection is a new area in Ghana, there have not been any recent legal developments. \"However, we understand that the regulator in Ghana has been discussing this with regulators in other African countries to consolidate and harmonise data protection laws, and adopt standard data protection laws across the continent. This is due to the emerging discussions on data sovereignty, economization and data localization. - 2024-04-14 \n",

      "Post ajouté: Samuel Ubido CEng MIETSamuel Ubido CEng MIET -  Saturday Thoughts: Cybersecurity in Africa – Challenges & OpportunitiesDuring a recent conversation with Ndéa Patricia Yoka, host of Business Africa at Africanews, we discussed the growing cybersecurity challenges across Africa. Cybercrime cost the continent $4 billion in 2022, with attacks targeting critical sectors like infrastructure.Here are some key insights from our discussion:Awareness Gaps: Cybersecurity has historically been under-prioritised in Africa. Many organisations lack the training, skills, and budgets to effectively combat cyber threats.  My Take: Leaders must implement cybersecurity frameworks and invest in regular training to build a security-conscious culture across their teams.AI as a Double-Edged Sword: AI has the potential to enhance defences, but it also introduces new risks if exploited by cybercriminals.  My Take: Combining AI tools with human expertise and setting up AI governance structures are critical steps to ensure AI is an asset, not a liability.Government Support & Regulation: Governments play a vital role in providing budgetary support and ensuring cybersecurity legislation is understood and enforced.  My Take: Public-private partnerships are essential. Governments need to create incentives for cybersecurity investments and facilitate information sharing to build a more robust ecosystem.Education & Infrastructure Investment: By investing in education and digital infrastructure, Africa can protect itself from future cyber threats while capitalising on AI’s potential.  My Take: Prioritising cybersecurity education from schools to professional certifications will build a more robust workforce, and digital infrastructure investment will be crucial to keeping pace with technological advances.Looking ahead, AI could add $1.2 billion to Africa’s GDP by 2030—but we must act now to secure our digital future.

The next decade will be critical as Africa continues its digital acceleration. Here’s my personal view on what lies ahead:1. Cybersecurity as a Foundation for Economic Growth: Africa’s tech ecosystem is booming, and with it comes a rising demand for secure, resilient infrastructure. Cybersecurity will be the backbone that supports everything from fintech to e-commerce, helping build trust in digital platforms and attracting more investment.2. Home Grown Cyber Experts: Africa has one of the youngest, most dynamic populations in the world. I believe we’re going to see a significant rise in homegrown cybersecurity experts, with a stronger focus on education, certifications, and skill development. This talent will not only serve Africa but will become a global force.3. AI and Automation in Cyber Defense: As threats evolve, the way we defend our digital assets will change too. Artificial intelligence and automation will drive much of the innovation in cybersecurity, enabling us to respond faster and predict risks before they become critical.4. Collaborative Security Frameworks: No single organization or country can tackle cybersecurity alone. I see African governments, private companies, and international partners working closer than ever to create regulations and frameworks that address our unique challenges while ensuring data privacy and protection.5. Cloud Security Leading the Charge: With many African businesses and governments moving to the cloud, secure cloud solutions will become the norm. We’ll see more investment in cloud-native security technologies to keep up with this shift and protect data at every level.The next 10 years will redefine cybersecurity in Africa. It’s an exciting time to be part of this journey, and I’m committed to helping shape a secure, resilient digital future for our continent.hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Africa hashtag#TechLeadership hashtag#DigitalTransformation hashtag#CloudSecurity hashtag#AI hashtag#Innovation hashtag#FutureOfWork - 2024-10-14 \n",

      "Post ajouté: Emone Emmanuel, PhDEmone Emmanuel, PhD - Attracting Artificial Intelligence Investments in Africa Dr. Emone. C. Emmanuel IntroductionArtificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize economies and societies. For African governments, attracting AI investments can drive innovation, create jobs, and enhance productivity across various sectors. This research paper explores strategies that African governments can employ to attract AI investments, supported by real-world examples.1. Developing a Robust Regulatory Framework.A clear and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for attracting AI investments. Governments should establish policies that promote ethical AI use, protect data privacy, and ensure fair competition.Example:Kenya: Kenya has been proactive in developing AI regulations. The government has implemented policies to protect data privacy and promote ethical AI use, which has attracted companies like OpenAI and WorldCoin.2. Investing in Digital Infrastructure.Investments in digital infrastructure, such as high-speed internet, data centers, and cybersecurity, are essential to support AI development and deployment.Example:Rwanda: Rwanda has invested heavily in its digital infrastructure, including the rollout of 4G networks nationwide and the establishment of innovation hubs. This has made Rwanda an attractive destination for tech companies and AI startups.3. Promoting Education and Skills Development.Building a skilled workforce is vital for AI innovation. Governments should invest in education and training programs to develop AI expertise.Example:Nigeria: Nigeria has launched several initiatives to promote AI education, including partnerships with tech companies to provide AI training and certification programs. This has helped create a pool of skilled professionals ready to work in the AI sector.4. Creating Innovation Hubs and IncubatorsInnovation hubs and incubators provide startups with the resources and support they need to develop and scale AI solutions. These hubs can attract both local and international investments.Example:South Africa: The Tshimologong Digital Innovation Precinct in Johannesburg is a prime example of an innovation hub that supports tech startups, including those focused on AI. It offers resources such as funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities.5. Fostering Public-Private Partnerships.Collaborations between the government and private sector can drive AI innovation and investment. Public-private partnerships can provide funding, expertise, and infrastructure needed for AI projects.Example:Egypt: Egypt has fostered public-private partnerships to advance its AI agenda. The government collaborates with tech giants like IBM and Microsoft to develop AI solutions for various sectors, including healthcare and agriculture.https://lnkd.in/drrymXbf - 2024-10-01 \n",

AI developers need to implement security practices that have become standard in other areas of software development, including supply chain transparency (through what is known as a “software bill of materials”) and the establishment of rigorous, objective testing and validation procedures.2. The industry needs to develop a transparent way to measure reliability and security. The threshold of acceptable risk will vary from context to context, but until some objective metric can be placed on the riskiness of AI, everything will be in the unenforceable realm of “appropriate” and “reasonable.” We have objective standards in other fields, from building codes to airplane autopilots. 3. Developers need to stop releasing to the public AI models that pose serious, unmitigated risks. In this regard, the rapid roll-out of insecure AI is no different from the software industry’s long habit of shipping insecure product, only to have to patch it later. The Biden administration’s cybersecurity strategy calls out this ship-and-patch mentality as a major reason why our computer systems are so insecure, and the same holds for AI.

      "Post ajouté: Melody Musoni, PhDMelody Musoni, PhD - TO REGULATE OR NOT TO REGULATE?This used to be the question when it came to AI. But it is quite obvious that we need to live in a society with rules and regulations. John Barlow's Declaration of Cyberspace Independence doesn't work. The question we should be asking ourselves is WHEN TO REGULATE? When should least developed countries start regulating AI? How do we get to the point of AI Regulation from a point where countries are still battling with internet access, data protection and basic cybersecurity? Should countries start with AI regulatory sandboxing to get a better contextual understanding of AI and their unique needs? Should they conduct AI risk assessments and feasibility studies first? Should they start with policies and AI strategies? Any of these options require a lot of money, money that may not be available for most developing countries.Fortunately, UNESCO and the European Commission have committed to provide €4 million towards the establishment of national AI legislation in developing countries. This financial commitment will make a huge difference for these countries. But this brings me back to my earlier question - when should we regulate AI? Is this the right time for developing countries like African countries to start regulating AI? Is it more strategic if this money goes towards helping African governments understand AI, identify their needs, risks and opportunities in AI and develop fit for purpose AI Regulation? Since most of these governments lack the financial muscle to do these AI studies, getting funding from the EC and developing an AI law may be the easy way out. The danger with this is they are likely to copy and paste regulation from their funders, which may not always be applicable in their country context. We have seen this with data protection regulation. (After moving to Europe, I now understand why they had to have the GDPR in place. There is too much personal data collected. You can't even get a trash bin without getting your personal data processed. This is very different from most African countries). Public consultation and participation is part of the democratic machinery when passing new laws. The problem is most people in Africa don't understand or know anything about AI. So they may not be able to contribute towards the shaping of AI Laws. How will I be able to explain the risks of AI to my rural community in Zimbabwe where internet signal is very bad and people occasionally use internet for WhatsApp? I think at times we are caught up in this hype of regulatory frenzy and forget about realities in certain areas.https://lnkd.in/eXhA8pME - 2024-10-08 \n",

The report touched on 3 main technologies applicable in the FinTech industry. These are AI, Blockchain, and Cloud Services. Below are my key takeaways from the report with a few additions. Artificial Intelligence (AI)1. Largest AI developers in Africa are South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, and Morocco.2. Ghana is at 6th position with 115 companies specializing in AI.3. The downside of AI in Africa are that it is more likely to further the pre-existing biases and oppression of women, ethnic minorities, and marginalized groups. 4. There also exists a gender diversity issue in the AI industry, with 71% of employees being male and 29% being female. Similarly, AI development students are 77% male and 23% female.AI Regulation & Strategy1. The first national AI strategy frameworks in Africa were developed by Egypt, Mauritania, and Rwanda. 2. The current situation is that governments are struggling to keep pace with the development of AI technology. 3. AI companies in the private sector now practice self-regulation as a result.4. The persistent public sentiment is that regulating AI policy does not match the needs of the citizens presently.5. In June of 2023, Ghana’s Minister of Communications assured parliament that measures were being put in place to regulate AI.AI & E-commerce1. The current relationship between AI and e-commerce is a positive one.2. The mass adoption and vast data as a result of digital-only interactions allow for the creation of individualized financial products. 3. It also allows for faster creation and training of algorithms in Africa as compared to developed nations.4. Some of the uses to which AI is being put to are;a. customer behavior analysis b. demographics c. personalized customer experiences d. cybersecurity and fraud prevention (likely by holders of PFTSP license in Ghana).The Problems Identified with African E-commerce1. Unavailability of data as a result of less digitized locations.2. Limited data collection methods.3. Shortage of talent in the data science field in Africa.BLOCKCHAIN1. Ownership of digital currency has been expanding in Africa, with Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa having the highest number of users of crypto assets. 2. African FinTechs and financial services industries are embracing blockchain due to its peculiar nature (of being immutable, decentralized, and transparent) for;a. remittancesb. supply chain financingc. digital identity verificationd. peer-to-peer lending etc.hashtag#fintech hashtag#finextra hashtag#AIhashtag#future - 2024-10-11 \n",

      "Post ajouté: Tony RidleyTony Ridley - It is naive to think you 'aren't valuable' to criminals, thieves, curious digital nomads and active cyber foragers, no matter your physical location, wealth, status and age. It is naive to think there are incalculable, infallible, and 24/7 digital walls, barriers, complex security and 'protection' between you, harm, loss, disruption, destruction or exploitation. But it's not you; specifically, they may be hunting or seeking to leverage, but that of your community, locale, country or demographic(s). Moreover, a single adversary prefers to hunt the pack, like a predatory African mammal, like a lion. But instead of hunting a pack for a single meal (usually the slowest, weakest or least attentive), contemporary, syndicated, capable and persistent digital threats want to consume the entire herd... or multiple herds at once. Forget physical apex predators; the modern digital adversary, both human-centric (corporeal) and automated (AI, ML, Bots, etc.), continues to be an adaptive, agile and intelligent danger the world and human history have never experienced. Unlike traditional or conventional criminals, bad actors and terrorists are limited in time, space and effort to harm and attack victims. Even wars are constrained to specific territories, adversaries and munitions. Digital actors can achieve mass casualties with the click of a mouse or by hitting enter on their devices. You, your business, your community, your data, your life, your information, your money, your health and your future are all worthy rewards in one form or another to one or more digital predators. Remembering, of course, the digital predator may be a child, elderly, person with a disability, infirm or gravely ill (and invisible to you or the other side of the world), but they remain a deadly and effective predator nonetheless. Defying conventional reasoning or thinking of who may/may not be a threat or cause you harm.

      "Post ajouté: Ibrahim SalifouIbrahim Salifou - Nabhane Mohamed NOUHOUMShamim nabuuma KaliisaDjamiou Ohounko (Baba)When we dive into the world of fintech, it becomes crystal clear that intellectual property (IP) is absolutely central. I mean, it's the beating heart of modern legal systems, especially in the fintech arena. We're talking about this dynamic field that brings together creativity, innovation, and the financial sector. Now, IP covers a whole bunch of intangible stuff like patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. And here's the kicker – these give creators and innovators these special rights that are all about exclusivity.Now, in the ever-moving fintech landscape, where tech and finance get all tangled up, IP law plays a starring role in pushing growth and making sure competition is on the level. This is where the legal framework rolls out the red carpet for developers, entrepreneurs, and financial institutions to put their time, money, and effort into their ideas. They know that their IP is going to be shielded and respected.What's really cool about IP law in fintech is how it strikes this delicate balance between giving creators their special rights and making sure knowledge spreads. Sure, IP rights give creators the power to call the shots on how their stuff is used. But hold on – there are limits too. The law takes a step back and tries to find that sweet spot between what creators want and what's good for the fintech community as a whole. That's why you've got these exceptions and rules that let you do things like research, fair use, and critical analysis.With fintech going global, the harmony of IP laws across different places takes the spotlight. International agreements, like the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), have kind of paved the way for a unified approach to IP protection.But wait, the fintech world isn't all smooth sailing. There are challenges too, like digital piracy, the need to shield algorithms and secret sauce software, and ensuring that our cybersecurity game is on point. And let's not forget about the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning – they're throwing a spanner in the works. We're having these deep conversations about who really owns the AI-generated financial stuff and algorithms.So, summing it up, the whole world of intellectual property law in fintech is this big, swirling ecosystem that has a massive impact on how we build, share, and protect financial technology innovations. In the face of new tech and fresh financial solutions, IP laws are changing up their game to make sure creators are looked after, all while giving fintech innovation a safe space to keep growing. - 2024-10-09 \n",

According to a report by Performanta, the continent is being used as a testing ground for ransomware operations. Despite progress in cybersecurity, many nations still lack strong national defenses, making them vulnerable targets. ️Why Africa?  Weaker systems in certain regions provide cyber gangs the opportunity to refine their methods before moving on to attack more secure countries. A recent ransomware incident involving South Africa’s National Health Laboratory Service highlights the urgency for enhanced cybersecurity measures across the continent. Signs to Watch:Cybercriminals are no longer limiting their attacks to high-value sectors like finance or energy. We're seeing an uptick in ransomware campaigns across a variety of industries, particularly in Kenya and Nigeria. Many businesses remain underprotected, with only 17 African nations having a national cybersecurity strategy in place. The Solution? Stronger regional collaboration and updated cybersecurity strategies are crucial to staying ahead of these evolving threats. African businesses must be proactive and fortify their defenses to prevent being used as testing grounds for global cybercriminals.hashtag#Cybersecurity hashtag#Africa hashtag#Ransomware hashtag#CyberDefense hashtag#DigitalSecurity hashtag#AfricaTech hashtag#ThreatIntelligence - 2024-10-01 \n",

This alarming trend is also evident in Africa. In 2023, the continent recorded the highest number of weekly cyberattacks per organizationThe Internet, a cornerstone of this technological era, is vital for managing critical infrastructures, executing secure financial transactions, maintaining connections with loved ones, indulging in online shopping, and accessing a wealth of information and entertainment.However, the digital age comes with its own set of challenges, mainly, the escalating threat of cybercrime. As technology advances, so do the tactics used by cybercriminals, who employ increasingly sophisticated methods to exploit vulnerabilities, posing a significant risk to individuals and organizations alike. Victims are often left financially, psychologically and emotionally destitute.The Economic Impact of CybercrimeThe economic toll of cybercrime in Africa is substantial. According to a report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), cybercrime costs African countries an estimated 1.5% of their GDP annually. This figure is likely to increase as the continent's digital economy grows.Social engineering(a type of attack that exploits human psychology to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information) plays a role in 52% of successful attacks on organizations and 91% on individuals in Africa. Several factors contribute to the rise of cybercrime in Africa;- Rapid Digitalization - Lack of Cybersecurity Awareness ️- Weak Cybersecurity Infrastructure ️- Organized Crime ‍️The volume and impact of cybercrimes continue to surge across Africa. Ransomware, business email compromise, and other online scams were the fastest growing cyber threats in 2023. Based on INTERPOL data, in recent years, Ghana’s government institutions, the national banks of Zambia and South Sudan, government institutions in Ethiopia, Senegal and Zimbabwe, and a popular South African Internet service provider have all been subjected to ransomware attacks.To combat cybercrime effectively, a multi-faceted approach is required. This includes;- Investing in robust cybersecurity infrastructure.- Raising awareness about cybersecurity threats and best practices.- Developing and implementing laws/regulations to address cybercrime and strengthening law enforcement capabilities to investigate and prosecute cybercriminals.- Fostering international cooperation among governments, law enforcement agencies, and private sector organizations to combat cybercrime on a global scale.As Africa continues to embrace digital technologies, it is imperative to prioritize cybersecurity to protect its economic growth and development. By addressing the challenges posed by cybercrime, the continent can harness the full potential of the digital age while minimizing the risks. - 2024-10-10 \n",

The first project focused on cyber threat intelligence (CTI), which focuses on gathering information to identify vulnerabilities and threats. A few days ago, I used open-source tools (e.g., Whois, Domain Dossier, VirusTotal, etc.) to conduct CTI about SecureX, a hypothetical fintech company based in Nigeria.After gathering relevant information, my team and I conducted a risk assessment to discuss the vulnerabilities and threats every asset identified is susceptible to. We also discussed the controls to stem the tide of the weaknesses. The fun (and not-so-fun-bit ) was the research on threat actors/ransomware groups likely to attack SecureX. I focused on Phobos, LockBit, Scattered Spider, & FIN7. Like clockwork, the bulk of the attacks from the aforementioned ransomware groups focused on the banking industry, the same sector SecureX operates (see image 2).The most intriguing part was using the MITRE ATT&CK framework to understand the threat, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) of malicious actors, especially Phobos, which I examined in great detail. Some facts about the Phobos group: 1. They attacked 600+ companies in the first half of 2024 alone, which is the second highest behind LockBit with 1,360 attacks (see image 1 for the full scoop). They are active in Africa and (specifically) Nigeria. In July 2024, the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT) released mitigation steps against the malicious group. Read it here: https://lnkd.in/dMQZWJDb 2. They have multiple variants (Faust, 8Base, Elking) using their malware strain. Each variant uses unique invasion tactics and tools, making it hard to defend against the group. 3. They’re master phishers, but that's not all: they know how to exploit remote desktop protocols.

      "Post ajouté: Frank Iseh CISSP.Frank Iseh CISSP. - The Growing Threat of Targeted Spear Phishing Against Senior Executives in AfricaAs Africa's business landscape rapidly evolves, so does the sophistication of cyber threats, particularly targeted spear phishing aimed at senior executives. This alarming trend underscores the urgent need for heightened awareness and protective measures among Africa's leadership.Understanding Spear Phishing in the African ContextSpear phishing campaigns are no longer just a Western concern; they are increasingly tailored to exploit the unique dynamics of African organizations. Cybercriminals often conduct thorough research, gathering personal and professional information from social media, corporate websites, and public records. This allows them to craft convincing messages that resonate with their targets, often making use of local languages and cultural references.Why Executives Are TargetedSenior executives in Africa are prime targets for several reasons:1. Access to Sensitive Information: Executives have the keys to a wealth of confidential data, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals seeking to exploit financial or intellectual property.2. Increased Digitalization: As companies across Africa embrace digital transformation, the attack surface grows. Many organizations lack robust cybersecurity frameworks, making them more vulnerable.3. Busy Schedules: Executives often juggle numerous responsibilities, which can lead to a lapse in vigilance. A well-crafted email can easily slip through the cracks, especially when it appears to come from a trusted source.Consequences of Successful AttacksThe repercussions of spear phishing can be particularly severe in Africa. Beyond immediate financial losses, organizations may face regulatory penalties, loss of customer trust, and even reputational damage on a continental scale. Given the rapid growth of the African market, the stakes have never been higher. A successful attack not only impacts the targeted company but can also ripple through entire industries.Prevention Strategies1. Education and Training: Continuous training is essential. Executives should be educated about the latest phishing techniques and how to recognize suspicious communications.2. Verification Protocols: Encourage a culture of verification. Simple practices, such as confirming requests via a phone call, can thwart potential attacks.3. Robust Cybersecurity Frameworks: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) and advanced threat detection systems tailored to the specific challenges faced by African businesses.ConclusionAs spear phishing becomes more prevalent in Africa, protecting senior executives must be a top priority. By fostering a culture of cybersecurity awareness and implementing effective measures. Together, we can build a safer business environment for Africa's executives and the organizations they lead.hashtag#cloudsecurity hashtag#phishing hashtag#digitalwitch hashtag#azure hashtag#gcp hashtag#cybersecurity hashtag#staysafe hashtag#securityawareness - 2024-05-15 \n",

The exercise provided crucial insights into threat analysis, defense strategies, and ways to safeguard SecureX’s sensitive data.Key Threats and ActorsThe exercise revealed that ransomware groups like Phobos, LockBit, CL0P, Scattered Spider, and FIN7 pose significant risks to financial institutions. Phobos, particularly active in Nigeria and Africa, emerged as one of the most dangerous adversaries. Known for its evolving attack methods, Phobos exploitsvulnerabilities in systems like Microsoft Windows to infiltrate organizationsand disrupt operations.Defense Evasion and ToolsThreat actors like Phobos use legitimate tools such as Universal Virus Sniffer (UVS), Process Hacker, and Power Tool to disable security systems like antivirus and firewalls. This emphasizes the need for vigilant internal monitoring to ensure these tools are used responsibly and are not exploited by attackers.Credential Theft and Data ExfiltrationAttackers leverage tools like BloodHound, Mimikatz, and NirSoft to steal credentials and escalate privileges. They then use file transfer protocols like WinSCP and cloud services to exfiltrate data, often before deploying ransomware. Monitoring for unauthorized access and suspicious data transfers is critical to prevent such theft.Backup Targeting and Recovery ChallengesPhobos cripples recovery efforts by targeting backup systems, using tools like vssadmin.exe to disable Volume Shadow Copies, leaving organizations with no choice but to pay ransoms or lose data. The exercise stressed the importance of maintaining offsite backups to ensure data recovery.MitigationStrategies Keystrategies to strengthen SecureX’s security include:1.Strengthening DNS and Firewall Security to block malicious domains.2.Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to protect against credentialtheft.3.Regular Certificate Management to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.4.Real-time Monitoring via SIEM for proactive threat detection.5.Security Audits and Employee Awareness Training to address evolving threats.Collaboration and ConclusionCollaboration within the cybersecurity community, aligning with standards like NIST, and engaging with organizations like FS-ISAC are critical for staying ahead of emerging threats.

In the right hands and used responsibly, this data represents limitless opportunities for growth and digital advancement. In the wrong hands, it exposes individuals and organisations to levels of cybercrime that have the potential to cause untold financial and data losses, even crippling businesses.Recent market research reports that the global big data market is set to grow from USD 138.9 billion in 2020 to USD 229.4 billion by 2025, due in part to the escalating demand for data-driven decision-making by organisations looking to gain a competitive advantage.With big data comes the need for equally substantial cyber security solutions. 𝗔𝗳𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗮’𝘀 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗰𝘆𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲With African countries at various stages of implementing digital transformation initiatives, the continent has become a fertile hunting ground for increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals. With the number of internet users in Africa expected to reach 1.1 billion by 2029, cyber security has never been more important. In South Africa for instance, the Allianz Risk Barometer ranks cyber incidents as the second most dangerous risk (after critical infrastructure blackouts).From ransomware to phishing, malware and data breaches, the methods are varied, and the results are often catastrophic. Compounding this are outdated, inflexible (and often manual) legacy security controls that can’t keep pace with the enormous scale of data being produced. The result: many African organisations find themselves on the receiving end of threats that simply couldn’t be detected or responded to quickly enough. 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀To mitigate these threats, businesses are increasingly working with technology companies like Liquid Intelligent Technologies (Liquid) to automate cyber security-related tasks traditionally performed by human analysts, such as monitoring networks, identifying vulnerabilities, and responding to incidents. Using advanced software and technologies to take care of these tasks results in increased efficiencies, reduced instances of human error, and faster response times. Employees are freed up to concentrate on other aspects of the business.In an even more advanced step, predictive analytics analyse the large sets of data generated by organisations to identify patterns and predict and mitigate potential threats before they even occur.

      "Post ajouté: Jan NelJan Nel - Digital identity and high-value asset identification: Safeguarding your most critical resources Safeguarding a person’s digital identity has become vital in today’s connected environment. Unlike IDs and passports, a digital identity encompasses all the unique identifiers and credentials that individuals use to authenticate themselves online. The scope of this is therefore significant and requires a considered approach to protect as effectively as possible. Usernames, passwords, biometric data, and even digital certificates all form part of a digital identity. However, when it comes to high-value assets, the focus turns to recognising and safeguarding the most critical assets within a company. If any of these are compromised, the business will likely suffer significant financial and reputational damage. There is also the potential of disrupting daily operations thereby exacerbating the cost aspects. High-value assets can include data, intellectual property, proprietary information, and critical infrastructure. The consequences of cyberattacks on South African organisations have been significant, with a 10% reduction in GDP attributed to cybercrime. While many companies believe that as long as they have firewalls and encryption in place, their most critical resources are safe, the reality is quite different. These traditional cybersecurity solutions often overlook the sophisticated tactics that cybercriminals use to breach these defences. Phishing, social engineering, and credential stuffing are just some of the ways malicious users can gain unauthorised access to sensitive systems and data. With South Africa becoming the 5th highest country in the world for cybercrime, securing digital identities on both personal and high-asset levels has become non-negotiable. To mitigate these risks, companies need to employ a comprehensive approach to digital identity management and high-value asset protection. Extensive identity and access management (IAM) solutions that ensure only authorised users can access critical systems are integral in this regard. These solutions include multi-factor authentication (MFA), regular auditing of access rights, and the use of advanced analytics to detect and respond to unusual activity. When it comes to high-value assets, businesses need to extensively audit and identify their most critical resources. The best way to defend these resources is to adopt layered security measures. These could include encryption, real-time monitoring, and segmentation of networks to limit the potential impact of a breach. C-suite executives must understand that digital identity and high-value asset protection have evolved beyond ‘IT’s problem’. Instead, they are business priorities. By focusing on these areas, organisations can take the required steps to defend against cyber threats while also building a resilient environment that can help safeguard their most valuable resources. - 2024-10-10 \n",

      "Post ajouté: David OdesDavid Odes -  How often do you hear about a foreign government hijacking another nation’s surveillance tools?Well, it just happened. Chinese hackers reportedly infiltrated U.S. telecom networks, accessing the same tools used by the U.S. authorities to monitor Americans. For months, they stayed undetected, silently collecting sensitive data.Here’s the problem: Governments worldwide require telecom providers to install backdoors for national security purposes. But these access points can easily be exploited by foreign actors, putting citizen privacy at risk.The U.S. breach is alarming—but the implications for Africa are even more concerning:• Nigeria has spent over $2.7B on surveillance systems in the last decade.• African governments continue to invest billions into these technologies.• Chinese firms dominate Africa's surveillance tech market.• These systems are already misused to spy on citizens and political opponents—and once compromised, they expose personal data to foreign governments.Bottom line: Governments can’t be trusted to protect your digital privacy.This is why you have to take your privacy into your own hands:1. Secure Your Communications: Use encrypted channels like Signal or WhatsApp. Calls & texts on those platforms are end-to-end encrypted and are much safer for sensitive discussions. Switch to ProtonMail for sensitive emails.2. Strengthen Your Security: Install reputable VPNs like ProtonVPN & or use Cloudflare WARP to protect your browsing history. Keep devices updated and use password managers like Bitwarden.3. Protect Your Identity: Enable two-factor authentication and regularly review privacy settings in your social media apps. Have different emails for various services. 4. Stay Informed: Learn about your country's data protection laws, follow digital rights organisations like Web Security Lab, and audit your digital footprint regularly.Your privacy is your responsibility—don't leave it in the hands of those who might exploit it.Oh, and by the way...

The lecture was moderated by Prof Admire Mare with Prof Sarah Chiumbu and Prof Allen Munoriyarwa being discussants.While digital platforms are varied, my interest is more in AI. This is moreso because the increased uptake of AI tools warrants the question of whether African countries should exercise their hashtag#sovereignty and leapfrog to AI regulation, or alternatively take their time to acquire knowledge around AI.I generally agree with perspectives that contend that African nations should not prioritise the enactment of AI-specific hashtag#legislation, but rather concentrate on enhancing the fundamental standards governing data management. The effective implementation and enforcement of data protection legislation constitutes the initial step in the progression towards AI regulation. Data protection legislation offers directives on the handling of personal data, including biometrics, the utilisation of profiling instruments, and automated processing, as well as the scope of these activities and the rights of persons.The Malabo Convention - the African Union (AU) Convention on Cyber Security and Personal Data Protection, already operational – serves as a crucial instrument for regulating elements of AI, including the automated processing of personal data. For data protection laws to effectively regulate AI in Africa, it is essential for the 18 African countries lacking such legislation to enact pertinent national laws.Africa must prioritise the establishment of robust data regulators with enforcement capabilities, exemplified by Kenya’s Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) and South Africa’s Information Regulator. The legislative hashtag#framework should be structured to ensure that data regulators possess enhanced financial, institutional, and political independence, hence preventing susceptibility to political and commercial sector coercion and intimidation.The implementation of premature regulation may hinder hashtag#innovation. The wait-and-see strategy includes comprehending AI technology into controlled contexts, such as AI regulatory hashtag#sandboxes, where these technologies are evaluated against current regulations.Thoughts?

By the second half of 2022, data from Tekedia highlighted the top five areas into which investors poured funds. They are FinTech, logistics and mobility, HealthTech, e-commerce, and EdTech. Upon seeing Tekedia’s report, I couldn’t help but ask myself: Where is cybersecurity? Is no one building a cybersecurity solution or startup worthy of investment in Africa?While well-invested industries are critical to economic growth, it’s worth noting that failing to invest in digital safety will invite severe consequences for governments, businesses and individuals.Africa isn’t immune to threat actors As the world deepens and widens its unbridled romance with the internet and technology, government and corporate agencies are more vulnerable to digital invasions by a teeming population of threat actors. No country is immune, and the potential damage from cyberattacks varies depending on the level of preparedness of the target. Consider the case of the West African country of Liberia. Over a million Lonestar Cell MTN customers were suddenly denied internet access in 2016, thanks to the calculated invasion of the network provider’s server with fake traffic. Although the authorities nabbed the culprit, multiple financial transactions failed and workers in the health and transport sectors bemoaned the loss of connectivity. This affirms the extent of the damage that hackers can deal to prey lacking a reliable firewall and other security mechanisms.Admittedly, the pandemic accelerated digital transformation for many countries and organisations. The work-from-home trend greatly improved employee engagement and productivity. But it came at a significant cost. As more jobs became remote, the risk of cyberattacks grew. Malicious actors capitalised on the increased population of travellers on the digital highway. - 2024-10-08 \n",

It's about having the right to choose our own path, to develop our own digital infrastructure, and to protect our own data.\" - Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda. Digital sovereignty is the ability of a country to control its own digital resources, including data, infrastructure, and technologies. It is essential for protecting national security, economic interests, and individual rights.Africa  is a continent with a diverse set of cultures, languages, and legal systems. This diversity can make it challenging to adopt common laws for digital sovereignty. Except for the 2014 African Union Convention on Cybersecurity and Data Protection, no single African law on digital sovereignty exists.I believe that a way to promote digital sovereignty is to build on existing regional institutions. For example, the African Union (AU) has a number of organs that could be involved in developing common laws for digital sovereignty. These include the AU's legal affairs department, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, and the African Union Inter-parliamentary Union.These different bodies would work together to promote the development of African-owned digital platforms and services, set clear rules and regulations for how data is collected and used, and promote regional cooperation on digital issueshashtag#africanunion hashtag#internetconnectivity hashtag#internet hashtag#afrikatech hashtag#africa hashtag#kenya hashtag#digitalsovereignty - 2024-10-01 \n",

The topics up for deliberation? 1) Protecting The Right of Migrant Workers2) Human Rights in the Digital SphereBy international standards, China isn't doing well in either area; whatever the definition of \"well\" is. I was naturally more interested in the second topic and I had some idea of China's peculiarity in the digital space.

Countries including Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Togo, Uganda and Zimbabwe have been implementing new measures to protect and secure the personal information of their citizens. In Ghana, data protection is regulated under the Data Protection Act, 2012 (DPA) together with Article 18(2) of the 1992 Constitution, which provides citizens with a fundamental right to privacy. Enid Baaba Dadzie, Senior Associate at Kimathi & Partners in Ghana, says that because data protection is a new area in Ghana, there have not been any recent legal developments. \"However, we understand that the regulator in Ghana has been discussing this with regulators in other African countries to consolidate and harmonise data protection laws, and adopt standard data protection laws across the continent.

Fortunately, South African cybersecurity professionals are developing local solutions to tackle these threats head-on.Cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility, involving collaboration between governments and the private sector. Initiatives like POPIA and partnerships are helping to build a stronger security framework.While generative AI brings benefits, it also creates more sophisticated threats. Ironically, the best way to govern AI is by using AI-driven strategies.Hackers have evolved. Instead of complex infrastructure hacks, they now target identity management systems and exploit human error, making social engineering one of the most dangerous threats today.Context-aware adaptive zero trust and conditional access now play key roles, assessing risks in real-time to ensure that access is granted only when conditions are secure.While technology is crucial, the hardest element to secure remains the human factor.

AI developers need to implement security practices that have become standard in other areas of software development, including supply chain transparency (through what is known as a “software bill of materials”) and the establishment of rigorous, objective testing and validation procedures.2. The industry needs to develop a transparent way to measure reliability and security. The threshold of acceptable risk will vary from context to context, but until some objective metric can be placed on the riskiness of AI, everything will be in the unenforceable realm of “appropriate” and “reasonable.” We have objective standards in other fields, from building codes to airplane autopilots. 3. Developers need to stop releasing to the public AI models that pose serious, unmitigated risks. In this regard, the rapid roll-out of insecure AI is no different from the software industry’s long habit of shipping insecure product, only to have to patch it later. The Biden administration’s cybersecurity strategy calls out this ship-and-patch mentality as a major reason why our computer systems are so insecure, and the same holds for AI.

      "Post ajouté: Melody Musoni, PhDMelody Musoni, PhD - TO REGULATE OR NOT TO REGULATE?This used to be the question when it came to AI. But it is quite obvious that we need to live in a society with rules and regulations. John Barlow's Declaration of Cyberspace Independence doesn't work. The question we should be asking ourselves is WHEN TO REGULATE? When should least developed countries start regulating AI? How do we get to the point of AI Regulation from a point where countries are still battling with internet access, data protection and basic cybersecurity? Should countries start with AI regulatory sandboxing to get a better contextual understanding of AI and their unique needs? Should they conduct AI risk assessments and feasibility studies first? Should they start with policies and AI strategies? Any of these options require a lot of money, money that may not be available for most developing countries.Fortunately, UNESCO and the European Commission have committed to provide €4 million towards the establishment of national AI legislation in developing countries. This financial commitment will make a huge difference for these countries. But this brings me back to my earlier question - when should we regulate AI? Is this the right time for developing countries like African countries to start regulating AI? Is it more strategic if this money goes towards helping African governments understand AI, identify their needs, risks and opportunities in AI and develop fit for purpose AI Regulation? Since most of these governments lack the financial muscle to do these AI studies, getting funding from the EC and developing an AI law may be the easy way out. The danger with this is they are likely to copy and paste regulation from their funders, which may not always be applicable in their country context. We have seen this with data protection regulation. (After moving to Europe, I now understand why they had to have the GDPR in place. There is too much personal data collected. You can't even get a trash bin without getting your personal data processed. This is very different from most African countries). Public consultation and participation is part of the democratic machinery when passing new laws. The problem is most people in Africa don't understand or know anything about AI. So they may not be able to contribute towards the shaping of AI Laws. How will I be able to explain the risks of AI to my rural community in Zimbabwe where internet signal is very bad and people occasionally use internet for WhatsApp? I think at times we are caught up in this hype of regulatory frenzy and forget about realities in certain areas.https://lnkd.in/eXhA8pME - 2024-10-11 \n",

The report touched on 3 main technologies applicable in the FinTech industry. These are AI, Blockchain, and Cloud Services. Below are my key takeaways from the report with a few additions. Artificial Intelligence (AI)1. Largest AI developers in Africa are South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, and Morocco.2. Ghana is at 6th position with 115 companies specializing in AI.3. The downside of AI in Africa are that it is more likely to further the pre-existing biases and oppression of women, ethnic minorities, and marginalized groups. 4. There also exists a gender diversity issue in the AI industry, with 71% of employees being male and 29% being female. Similarly, AI development students are 77% male and 23% female.AI Regulation & Strategy1. The first national AI strategy frameworks in Africa were developed by Egypt, Mauritania, and Rwanda. 2. The current situation is that governments are struggling to keep pace with the development of AI technology. 3. AI companies in the private sector now practice self-regulation as a result.4. The persistent public sentiment is that regulating AI policy does not match the needs of the citizens presently.5. In June of 2023, Ghana’s Minister of Communications assured parliament that measures were being put in place to regulate AI.AI & E-commerce1. The current relationship between AI and e-commerce is a positive one.2. The mass adoption and vast data as a result of digital-only interactions allow for the creation of individualized financial products. 3. It also allows for faster creation and training of algorithms in Africa as compared to developed nations.4. Some of the uses to which AI is being put to are;a. customer behavior analysis b. demographics c. personalized customer experiences d. cybersecurity and fraud prevention (likely by holders of PFTSP license in Ghana).The Problems Identified with African E-commerce1. Unavailability of data as a result of less digitized locations.2. Limited data collection methods.3. Shortage of talent in the data science field in Africa.BLOCKCHAIN1. Ownership of digital currency has been expanding in Africa, with Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa having the highest number of users of crypto assets. 2.

      "Post ajouté: Ibrahim SalifouIbrahim Salifou - Nabhane Mohamed NOUHOUMShamim nabuuma KaliisaDjamiou Ohounko (Baba)When we dive into the world of fintech, it becomes crystal clear that intellectual property (IP) is absolutely central. I mean, it's the beating heart of modern legal systems, especially in the fintech arena. We're talking about this dynamic field that brings together creativity, innovation, and the financial sector. Now, IP covers a whole bunch of intangible stuff like patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. And here's the kicker – these give creators and innovators these special rights that are all about exclusivity.Now, in the ever-moving fintech landscape, where tech and finance get all tangled up, IP law plays a starring role in pushing growth and making sure competition is on the level. This is where the legal framework rolls out the red carpet for developers, entrepreneurs, and financial institutions to put their time, money, and effort into their ideas. They know that their IP is going to be shielded and respected.What's really cool about IP law in fintech is how it strikes this delicate balance between giving creators their special rights and making sure knowledge spreads. Sure, IP rights give creators the power to call the shots on how their stuff is used. But hold on – there are limits too. The law takes a step back and tries to find that sweet spot between what creators want and what's good for the fintech community as a whole. That's why you've got these exceptions and rules that let you do things like research, fair use, and critical analysis.With fintech going global, the harmony of IP laws across different places takes the spotlight. International agreements, like the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), have kind of paved the way for a unified approach to IP protection.But wait, the fintech world isn't all smooth sailing. There are challenges too, like digital piracy, the need to shield algorithms and secret sauce software, and ensuring that our cybersecurity game is on point. And let's not forget about the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning – they're throwing a spanner in the works. We're having these deep conversations about who really owns the AI-generated financial stuff and algorithms.So, summing it up, the whole world of intellectual property law in fintech is this big, swirling ecosystem that has a massive impact on how we build, share, and protect financial technology innovations. In the face of new tech and fresh financial solutions, IP laws are changing up their game to make sure creators are looked after, all while giving fintech innovation a safe space to keep growing. - 2024-10-12 \n",

In the right hands and used responsibly, this data represents limitless opportunities for growth and digital advancement. In the wrong hands, it exposes individuals and organisations to levels of cybercrime that have the potential to cause untold financial and data losses, even crippling businesses.Recent market research reports that the global big data market is set to grow from USD 138.9 billion in 2020 to USD 229.4 billion by 2025, due in part to the escalating demand for data-driven decision-making by organisations looking to gain a competitive advantage.With big data comes the need for equally substantial cyber security solutions. 𝗔𝗳𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗮’𝘀 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵 𝗰𝘆𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲With African countries at various stages of implementing digital transformation initiatives, the continent has become a fertile hunting ground for increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals. With the number of internet users in Africa expected to reach 1.1 billion by 2029, cyber security has never been more important. In South Africa for instance, the Allianz Risk Barometer ranks cyber incidents as the second most dangerous risk (after critical infrastructure blackouts).From ransomware to phishing, malware and data breaches, the methods are varied, and the results are often catastrophic. Compounding this are outdated, inflexible (and often manual) legacy security controls that can’t keep pace with the enormous scale of data being produced. The result: many African organisations find themselves on the receiving end of threats that simply couldn’t be detected or responded to quickly enough. 𝗘𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀To mitigate these threats, businesses are increasingly working with technology companies like Liquid Intelligent Technologies (Liquid) to automate cyber security-related tasks traditionally performed by human analysts, such as monitoring networks, identifying vulnerabilities, and responding to incidents. Using advanced software and technologies to take care of these tasks results in increased efficiencies, reduced instances of human error, and faster response times. Employees are freed up to concentrate on other aspects of the business.In an even more advanced step, predictive analytics analyse the large sets of data generated by organisations to identify patterns and predict and mitigate potential threats before they even occur.

But for these companies to scale, thrive, and lead the Digital Ecosystem, one thing is non-negotiable: Digital Trust. Why Digital Trust MattersIn an era where transactions, data, and integrations are all moving online, trust becomes the currency that fuels growth. Customers, investors, and regulators demand it. It’s no longer enough to offer groundbreaking products or services; you need to ensure Security, Privacy, and Ethical use of technology.But how do African unicorns, companies valued at over $1 billion; build and maintain this Digital Trust? Three Pillars of Digital Trust for Africa’s Unicorns1. Security and Privacy by DesignFrom day one, unicorns need to embed security into every layer of their digital platforms. This means building systems with end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, and rigorous data privacy protocols. It’s not just about protecting data; it’s about giving customers the peace of mind that their information is in good hands.2. Transparency and AccountabilityTrust is earned when companies are open about how they collect, use, and protect data. African unicorns must lead by example, adopting transparent practices and being accountable when things go wrong. Whether it’s dealing with breaches or communicating changes in policy, honesty is what will set leaders apart from the rest.3. Compliance with Global StandardsAfrican tech giants can’t afford to think locally when it comes to Digital Trust. To attract international partners and customers, they must comply with global security standards like GDPR, SOC2, and ISO certifications. Being proactive about these regulations is crucial for building credibility on the world stage. Unlocking the Future of African Tech!Digital Trust is the foundation for enabling unicorns to grow beyond borders. The companies that invest in trust today will not only expand their reach but also pave the way for the next generation of African tech innovators. They will unlock new markets, attract global talent, and redefine what’s possible for the continent’s Digital Ecosystem.

The Nigerian government's official signing of the 'Designation and Protection of Critical National Information Infrastructure Order, 2024' is a significant step for the African continent. Mobile connectivity in Sub-Saharan Africa has the potential to drive socioeconomic advancement, impacting healthcare, education, digital commerce, industrial automation, and smart city infrastructure.For the telecoms industry, maintaining a benchmark of five nines (99.999%) network availability is essential to being 'Always ON'! System failures not only incur costs but can also impact lives and businesses significantly.Despite advancements, the cost of mobile data remains high in the region, with a gigabyte priced at roughly 4% of monthly GDP per capita, double the United Nations' affordability target of 2%. This disparity limits the potential of mobile technology to unlock opportunities, especially for low-income communities.Being 'Always On' and supported by Critical National Infrastructure designation is crucial in the age of Automation. This foundation is key to reducing digital service costs and fostering innovation in emerging technologies like blockchain, AI, APIs, and cloud, enhancing efficiency, security, and transparency. Dr. ‘Bosun Tijani Minister of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy - “The security and protection of these Critical National Information Infrastructure is a priority for this administration and will help improve the quality of telecoms services which has very often been affected by disruption and intentional damage”.

By the second half of 2022, data from Tekedia highlighted the top five areas into which investors poured funds. They are FinTech, logistics and mobility, HealthTech, e-commerce, and EdTech. Upon seeing Tekedia’s report, I couldn’t help but ask myself: Where is cybersecurity? Is no one building a cybersecurity solution or startup worthy of investment in Africa?While well-invested industries are critical to economic growth, it’s worth noting that failing to invest in digital safety will invite severe consequences for governments, businesses and individuals.Africa isn’t immune to threat actors As the world deepens and widens its unbridled romance with the internet and technology, government and corporate agencies are more vulnerable to digital invasions by a teeming population of threat actors. No country is immune, and the potential damage from cyberattacks varies depending on the level of preparedness of the target. Consider the case of the West African country of Liberia. Over a million Lonestar Cell MTN customers were suddenly denied internet access in 2016, thanks to the calculated invasion of the network provider’s server with fake traffic. Although the authorities nabbed the culprit, multiple financial transactions failed and workers in the health and transport sectors bemoaned the loss of connectivity. This affirms the extent of the damage that hackers can deal to prey lacking a reliable firewall and other security mechanisms.Admittedly, the pandemic accelerated digital transformation for many countries and organisations. The work-from-home trend greatly improved employee engagement and productivity. But it came at a significant cost. As more jobs became remote, the risk of cyberattacks grew. Malicious actors capitalised on the increased population of travellers on the digital highway. - 2024-10-10 \n",

It's about having the right to choose our own path, to develop our own digital infrastructure, and to protect our own data.\" - Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda. Digital sovereignty is the ability of a country to control its own digital resources, including data, infrastructure, and technologies. It is essential for protecting national security, economic interests, and individual rights.Africa  is a continent with a diverse set of cultures, languages, and legal systems. This diversity can make it challenging to adopt common laws for digital sovereignty. Except for the 2014 African Union Convention on Cybersecurity and Data Protection, no single African law on digital sovereignty exists.I believe that a way to promote digital sovereignty is to build on existing regional institutions. For example, the African Union (AU) has a number of organs that could be involved in developing common laws for digital sovereignty. These include the AU's legal affairs department, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, and the African Union Inter-parliamentary Union.These different bodies would work together to promote the development of African-owned digital platforms and services, set clear rules and regulations for how data is collected and used, and promote regional cooperation on digital issueshashtag#africanunion hashtag#internetconnectivity hashtag#internet hashtag#afrikatech hashtag#africa hashtag#kenya hashtag#digitalsovereignty - 2023-11-15 \n",
